# Fake-News-Classification-ISYE-6740-Project

Kaggle Competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-news/overview

# Introduction
Welcome to the Fake News Classifier project! This repository contains code and models for classifying news articles as either reliable or unreliable using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. In this project, we have implemented three different models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). These models are designed to help identify and combat the spread of fake news in today's digital age.

# Description
The project includes Kaggle notebooks that retrieve the necessary data for training and testing the models. Make sure you have a Kaggle account and your Kaggle API credentials set up on your machine. You can follow Kaggle's API documentation for more information.

## Models
### 1. LSTM
The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can capture long-range dependencies in text data.

### 2. BiLSTM
The BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory) model enhances the LSTM by processing input data in both forward and backward directions, allowing it to capture contextual information effectively.

### 3. BERT
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a state-of-the-art pre-trained transformer model for NLP tasks. We fine-tuned BERT for our fake news classification task.

## Results and Evaluation
The Kaggle Submission Files folder consists of files which were submitted to the competition for evaluation based on accuracy.
